				<h2>Top Bar Removed</h2>
				<p>We removed the bar that was at the top of the screen. It would allow you to quickly see the recent posts and more, but we have removed it. We removed it because it was starting to cause a lot of problems. On some pages it would not even show up. So for right now, we are just going to get rid of it. It may come back soon, but I don't know. Anyways, thanks for reading this and I hope that I will see you guys soon...</p>

				<h2>No-Label Bookmark Bar</h2>
				<p>Have you ever wanted a bookmarks bar that has no labels? There are plenty of reasons why you might want to have this. More space, more visual, spell out a message, etc.</p>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QPgK61n.png" loading="lazy">
				<p>It's actually really easy to do this! All you have to do is edit the bookmark and remove the bookmark name(not url).</p>

				<p>And that's it! I hope you learned something new!</p>

				<h2>Rainbow Shelf</h2>
				<p>The Chrome OS shelf is where all of your pinned apps are stored, but it's not that customizable. All you can do is pin apps, enable accessibility stuff, auto-hide it, change where it is on the screen, and change the color depending on your wallpaper. And that's about it. But have you ever wanted an animated rainbow shelf that changes color automatically? Well, I can get that for you!</p>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D2np40w.png" loading="lazy">
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mejEnTL.png" loading="lazy">
				<p>The first step is to disable the autohide shelf setting. This is really easy to do. If you don't have this done already and you want to know how to do it, here you go:<br>1. Right click on the taskbar. A menu like this should pop up.</p>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5urM6Ie.png" loading="lazy">
				<p>If it shows the option to enable autohide shelf than you are good. If it says always show shelf, then turn that on.<br>2. Make sure that your shelf is at the bottom of your screen. Right click on your shelf and go to shelf position and select bottom.</p>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SrOIFpm.png" loading="lazy">
				<p>Your shelf is now ready. The next step is to go to this website: <a href="https://www.gradient-animator.com/" target="_blank">https://www.gradient-animator.com/</a></p>
