	<li>if someones whole thing is that they "spread a forbidden message", it's probably best to ignore them</li>
	<li>the first day of work will always be one of the worst. you will constantly have a feeling of impending doom. it will get better after a couple days</li>
	<li>always make backups and save extra copies. you won't know what you miss until it's gone. if you see something that you like, save it</li>
	<li>speaking of that, when moving schools or when graduating, make a backup of your entire school google account. this will let you look back at your school projects, emails, and everything</li>
	<li>if something will take less than 5 minutes to do and you can do it, just do it. don't get in the habit of having an overwhelming backlog of tasks to complete</li>
