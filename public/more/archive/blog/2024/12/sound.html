		<p>Society has progressed past the need for devices to make sound, but I haven't. I love sound. But devices just don't make sound like they used to.</p>
<p>In the modern era it feels like the only time devices, especially computers, make sound is when there is an error or a new notification. Other than that, silence. And I don't like this.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that there needs to be a sound effect for every little action you perform. Old Android phones did this, and it got annoying really quickly. Some phones now still have some sounds for actions, for example iPhones have a clicking sound when you scroll through lists, and most phones have a sound effect for locking the device, making a purchase, and using the keyboard.</p>
<p>However, in terms of sounds, it feels like this is it. Not every action needs a sound effect, but some more would be nice. For example, I love being in the school computer lab and hearing everyone unzip a file on a Mac. It's like were all in this together.</p>
<p>However, even if we had sounds, nobody would hear them because everyone uses silent mode! I understand not wanting to have your phone go off in public, but at the same time I love it when it happens. Maybe if you're in church you can have it off, but if you're just in public, turn your sound on, I want to hear your phone.</p>
