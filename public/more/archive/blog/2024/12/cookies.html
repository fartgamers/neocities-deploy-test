		<h1>Making Cookies Isn&#39;t Fun</h1>

		<p>Do most people actually enjoy making holiday cookies and decorating them?</p>
<p>It's fun for like 15 minutes, but once you realize you have to decorate like 80 of these things, it stops being fun and starts being a chore. And maybe this is because I have always used frosting and decorations that are... crap, but decorating is just annoying. Frosting comes out too slow and never goes where you want it to go.</p>
<p>Granted, a lot of the fun of decorating a Christmas cookie is making an abomination that you will be ashamed of for many years to come. Either that, or just spreading a layer of frosting on top, maybe adding some sprinkles, and calling it good enough.</p>
<p>Decorating gingerbread houses is better anyways. When you decorate a gingerbread house, you're making a home and telling a story with said home. Plus  you have room to actually make something nice. When you're decorating cookies, you have a much smaller canvas, and you're not on as creative of a canvas. You can maybe make characters, but there is no story to tell. You may have cookies that are cut into specific shapes, but they're so abstract meaning is lost. I made a skull cookie and a black cat cookie this year for Christmas and <strong>nobody</strong> questioned the random Halloween themes.</p>
<p>Instead of decorating cookies this holiday season, start having a competition of who can make the funniest Fortnite joke with your family instead.</p>
