		<p>This place is slowly becoming less of a blog and more of a diary. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I will let you decide that on your own.</p>
<p>You may remember that I <a href="crash.html">drove into a metal pole</a>, talking out my left mirror. I don't want to be driving around without a left mirror, as that isn't really safe. So, I would need to get a new one.</p>
<p>I was expecting the new mirror to cost about <code>$1,000</code>, however it turns out it only cost about <code>$180</code> to replace. I don't know why I expected it to cost so much, but at the same time I'm being told by everyone that the deal I got was a steal.</p>
<p>The experience of going to the mechanic was really basic. I just went there, waited 30 minutes, and came out and there was a new mirror. Awesome!</p>
<p>Apparently, this is the second time that the mirror on this vehicle had to be replaced. Previously, the vehicle was broken into, and as apart of that they broke the mirrors. That sucks.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am just happy to be able to merge again.</p>
