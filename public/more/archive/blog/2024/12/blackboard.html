		<p>Discussion posts are a good idea, in theory. But in reality, they just end up being one of the worst, most miserable experiences.</p>
<p>The whole point of a discussion post is to bring classroom discussion online. The whole thing is that you are given a prompt that you have to reply to, and after that you have to reply to a few other people. This is a way to either discuss a topic, or to get feedback from other classmates.</p>
<p>In theory this sounds like it would work, and it does, for the most part. For work in progress check-ins, you usually do end up getting some valuable feedback. However, nobody really wants to be doing these discussions, so they all end up feeling the same.</p>
<p>You aren't expected to reply to your replies and start a conversation, you're only expected to reply to a few other classmates. There is no benefit to trying to argue a separate opinion. As a result, most people just end up saying things like &quot;I agree with you when you said that&quot; or something similar.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is sharing work in progress check-in posts, especially if you're using Canvas. Some people just have a really hard time replying with their work in progress. Some people like submitting the raw project file, instead of just a screenshot. And for some reason you cannot open an image in a new tab on Canvas without downloading the image. Fun!</p>
<p>And for large, complex projects the check-ins are ever worse. You have to reply to a certain number of people by a certain date, however most people are hesitating the project, so you basically have to wait until near the end of the due date before there is anybody to reply to.</p>
<p>Plus, when you do it feedback, it's usually just someone telling you &quot;I like this, keep it up&quot;.</p>
