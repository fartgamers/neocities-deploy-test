		<h1>Not Making a List</h1>

		<p>I have already talked about how much I <a href="gifts.html">don't like getting gifts</a>. But Christmas has always been extra stressful for me, mainly because I'm expected to make a list of things I want.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don't really have things I want, or the things I want are a little expensive. But the problem with that is more than one person is getting you gifts. So you have to come up with enough to make them go all around.</p>
<p>Not only this, but people are pressuring you to keep on making a list. They want one, they need one from you! And you only have so much time left. And you can't just say that you don't want anything. Man, I hate when people are being generous.</p>
<p>Plus, the problem with asking for a list is that people don't shop like how you do. For example, you might ask for something, and get some cheap knockoff, or something similar. I know you can send Amazon links to people, but that doesn't work all the time.</p>
<p>And just because you put something on your list doesn't mean you're going to get it!</p>
<p>Overall, just send me money. Or a new job.</p>
