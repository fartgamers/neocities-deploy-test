		<h1>DRM on the Radio</h1>

		<p>I was playing Grand Theft Auto V, listening to the radio stations when I noticed something. I realized that before a song would play, as well as near the end of a song, the announcers would make some random comment. I quickly recognized this as a way to prevent music theft. After all, in the age of YouTube to MP3, what's stopping someone from setting the game sound effects to low and recording the song?</p>
<p>This isn't a new thing, they do this all the time on the actual radio. The most infamous example would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSkGbr3IOqXxB0IZN38rmQEWc_sXnQozH" target="_blank">Casey Kasem</a> during the top 40 countdown. This was especially important back then, because there wasn't even Napster yet. Most people just accepted there would be some guy at the start of their songs, unless they purchased the full album.</p>
<p>Now, it feels like DRM isn't much of a thing on the radio anymore. There isn't much of a reason for it. People just use a streaming platform, and if they're <strong>desperate</strong> for music, they download with YouTube to MP3.</p>
<p>Or you use Soulseek, because you're a nerd. And you Tweet &quot;People still use Spotify?&quot; ever year during Wrapped.</p>
