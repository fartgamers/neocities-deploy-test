		<h1>Is the Internet Boring</h1>

		<p>On the current internet, you can find a ton of sentiment that the old internet was just &quot;better&quot;. In some cases, that is true. But I think there is another reason why the internet is boring: <strong>You've gotten used to it</strong>.</p>
<p>For most, if not everyone reading this blog, it's highly likely that the internet has been a thing for your entire life. Twitter is probably older than some of my readers, which is a really funny thing to think about. Some of you weren't even conscious when Instagram was new.</p>
<p>There have been so many innovations that we have just become used to. Remember when the built in photo editor on iPhones could only crop images and remove red eyes? Now you can adjust the lighting of videos, and a lot more.</p>
<p>The fact people watch YouTube on cellular data still amazes me. I don't understand how people are able to just do that. I still have limited data.</p>
<p>Point is, can you even imagine a world where uploading a 10 second video takes 5 minutes? This is just normal to everyone. You can scroll through your TikTok feed at a rapid pace and never run into an interruption. Did you notice that videos stopped loading the future parts? Seriously, watch that gray bar on YouTube, and you will see that it only extends about 30 seconds past what you're watching.</p>
<p>Next, people really like to repost content online. It's at the point where trends and inside jokes are starting to become recycled. First we had illuminati, than Among Us pattern recognition, and now we have hawk tuah. We had MLG parodies, then Arabfunny, and now we have hood irony. There is only so much that you can do before it becomes more of the same.</p>
<p>Point is, you're just used to the internet. Everything that there is to be seen has already been seen.</p>
