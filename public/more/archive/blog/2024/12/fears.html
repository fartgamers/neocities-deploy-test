		<h1>When I was Scared of Water and CAPTCHA</h1>

		<p>Everyone had one silly thing they were scared of at a young age. For most people (at least in the United States), I would guess television. More people than I thought were scared of logos (other than THX), but I feel everyone has a memory of watching TV alone and seeing an Emergency Alert System test. There was a nostalgiabait YouTube channel that posted a good video recreating this feeling, however the channel had no name so I can't find the video.</p>
<p>When I was younger, we had AT&amp;T U-Verse, so you could close out of emergency alerts. But there was still one time when the alert scared me so hard I cried. I was watching Wallace &amp; Gromit on Cartoon Network when they did a test of the alert system. It was scary because my cable box didn't let me turn the TV off or change the channel.</p>
<p>However, the thing about Emergency Alerts is they are supposed to be somewhat scary. That's how they get your attention. It makes sense to be scared of them when you're young. However, there were 2 other things I was really scared of when I was young.</p>
<h2>CAPTCHA</h2>
<p>My first willing encounter with CAPTCHA was in third grade, when in the computer lab a weird word appeared on someone else's screen. I couldn't read the word from where I was sitting, and I didn't want to. All I knew is that the word wasn't supposed to be there. I thought it was some kind of virus.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple weeks, and my computer in the computer lab wasn't working, so I went to another one. I shook the mouse, and the first thing I saw was the weird text on the Google login screen. My fight or flight kicked in, and I immediately shut down the computer. In my mind, that computer was now haunted.</p>
<p>This fear would continue until 5th grade when I decided to face my fear and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCr6rNaZ9EU" target="_blank">this video by Zuck That</a>. After that, all I talked about for a month was CAPTCHA. I made presentations, memes, and whatever. Now, it's just whatever to me.</p>
<h2>Water on Google Earth</h2>
<p>This next one sounds reasonable. After all, tons of people are scared of large amounts of water. However, I was only scared of the water on Google Earth satellite view, specifically the texture for the made up satellite imagery seen all over the ocean.</p>
<p>In the downloadable version of Google Earth (Google Earth Pro), this was made even worse, because the water has an animated texture, and you can actually fall into it. Plus, the built in tour had you go to the ocean floor to look at a model of the titanic. This is cool, but very scary. This isn't as much of an issue now, because the only people using Google Earth Pro are cool teachers and John Bois.</p>
<p>Satellite imagery in general still slightly freaks me out for some reason. I think the fear started with a &quot;10 Censored Things on Google Maps&quot; video. When I drag maps, I get worried I might accidentally drag into a body of water. I'm not even worried about falling through the screen into the water, I just don't like it. I at least have the confidence to sometimes zoom into the water until it's the only thing on my screen.</p>
