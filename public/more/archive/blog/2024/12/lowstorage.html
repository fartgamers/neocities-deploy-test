		<h1>Low Storage Will Be the Death of You</h1>

		<p>Having low storage, no matter what platform you are on, is a bad thing. But running low on storage is especially terrible if you are using iOS. Seriously, <strong>do not run out of storage on an iPhone or iPad</strong>.</p>
<p>First off, you will obviously be unable to save new things, and the system will run slower. This is expected, this happens on any platform. You should not be shocked by this behavior. Computers need storage in order to run efficiently. However, iOS devices will behave more strangely. For example, you will open apps and they will act like they have never seen you before. Not only that, but the system will sometimes start to continuously boot loop.</p>
<p>The main reason this starts becoming a problem is because you will find you're unable to clear up storage. If you delete a photo, the photo will automatically be undeleted. If you delete an app, the app will not be deleted. It will seem like there is nothing you can do.</p>
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>If you ever run into this situation, there are still a few things that you can do to free up storage. The biggest thing I would check for is clearing the cache of apps. These are especially the apps that clearing the cache will make your device usable again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>Any browser</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have any of these apps, try deleting files inside of apps. For example, clearing project files. This is what I mainly have to do.</p>
<p>However, it is still stupid that you can't just... delete an app.</p>
