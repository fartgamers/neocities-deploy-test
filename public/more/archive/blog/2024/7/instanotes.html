		<h2>the start of notes</h2>
		<p>instagram notes was released in late 2022. the feature allows you to set a 60 character status message that is visible only to your mututals. this message is only visible for 24 hours, and appears in a carousel at the top of the direct message page. its essentially a discord custom status. you can tap a note to reply to it, which just sends a dm to the person who wrote it.</p>

		<p>the whole reason for this feature was to make instagram feel like more of an app for close friends, probably in an attempt to make people post more (which younger people stopped doing as much as its "too stressful"). this feature quickly became popular, being compared to AOL Instant Messenger away messages. so, instagram decided to expand on it.<br>they added the ability to set a 30 second snippet of a song as your note (and it could be any 30 seconds, not just the itunes preview). they also added the ability to set a boomerang along with your note, which is a short, looping video without sound that has to be captured with the camera. the music feature is the main thing people use notes for, the boomerangs less often.<br>later on, the ability to like a note was also added. you could simply double tap a note to like it. i have no idea what liking a note actually does, but i assume it just sends a notification.<br>however, there was still one more expansion for notes that was removed later on. you could ask questions, and your friends could answer them. you could see the responses of your friends. but the thing with these questions was that the question would also be shared with the friends of anybody who answered the question.</p>
