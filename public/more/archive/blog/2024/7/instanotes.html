		<h2>the start of notes</h2>
		<p>instagram notes was released in late 2022. the feature allows you to set a 60 character status message that is visible only to your mututals. this message is only visible for 24 hours, and appears in a carousel at the top of the direct message page. its essentially a discord custom status. this feature quickly became popular, being compared to AOL Instant Messenger away messages.</p>

		<p>the whole reason for this feature was to make instagram feel like more of an app for close friends, probably in an attempt to make people post more (which younger people stopped doing as much as its "too stressful").</p>
