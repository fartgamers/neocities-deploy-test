<p>It's really obvious that navigation and consistency on my site is really poor. So today, I added a navbar that I will slowly be rolling out to all pages.<br>If you scroll down, you will now see a navbar with links to what I think are good top level pages. The navbar isn't on all pages yet, but it's on the important ones. If you're on mobile, the navbar should be replaced with a sidebar. I am working on making the button less in the way.<br>Anyways, some side pages have also been updated design wise. Woo-hoo.<br>This site recently hit 25,000 hits and 25 Neocities followers, which is cool. Thanks! I didn't expect this site to really take off, but I guess not abondoning a site does that to you.</p>
