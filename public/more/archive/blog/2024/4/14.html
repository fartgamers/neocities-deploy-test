		<p>i am now experimenting with making updates live at the end of the week, instead of with every commit. timely content like blog posts will still be published when they happen, but things like new pages, layout updates, features, and whatever won't be updated until the end of the week.<br>anyways, this is what is new this week:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>button directory has new views; list, button, and large button. please use them. it took forever to add and was really boring.</li>
			<li>each top level page now has its gradient displayed in the favicon. i will add more pages to this later.</li>
		</ul>
