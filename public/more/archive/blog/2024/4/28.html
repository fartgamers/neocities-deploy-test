			<h1>DO YOU HATE ME YET?</h1>
			<p>April 28, 2024</p>

		<p>We swept under the rug, dusted the pottery, and squashed some bugs. For the best experience, make sure your app is always up to date.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>added the original version of my late 2023 site redesign to the <a href="/more/archive/websites/homepages/index.html" target="_blank">website archive</a>. my goal was to kind of keep the design how it was at the start for subpages, but that clearly hasn't happened.</li>
			<li>fixed a bug where the navbar just didn't work. like at all. i think it's fixed. i HOPE its fixed</li>
			<li>much better noscript support. indicators of pages that won't work will appear when no javascript is available, as well as lots of elements that don't work with javascript will just vanish. i still have some work to do, but the experience isn't too compromising yet</li>
			<li>added what the kids call a shrine, but in reality its just a wiki that has 3 pages and none of them are finished</li>
			<li>do you like how on the homepage links have an underline instead of a highlight? no? well too bad, im adding this to more pages. this definitely doesn't go against my philosophy of "don't update the design of old pages"</li>
		</ul>
		<p>also, we hit 50 followers on neocities! that is cool i think, but followers dont matter. but hey, thanks anyways! to celebrate, this update log will be in a slight yellow</p>
