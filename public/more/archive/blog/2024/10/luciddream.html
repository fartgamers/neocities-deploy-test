		<p>Excuse the title, I don't like starting titles with &quot;I&quot;</p>
<p>I've been trying to lucid dream for like 3 years now, but I have never been able to successfully do so. A few weeks ago I had a dream that was almost a parody of lucid dreaming. To cite my dream journal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>while i was fake lucid i was basically inside of an untextured box in unity. there were just random models laying around. i tried killing someone because they always say not to do that in lucid dreams. the weird thing was that i followed all of the rules of lucid dreaming (imagining something out of sight and then turning to see it to summon objects). anyways, i failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was getting closer to finally having a lucid dream, but this still wasn't one.</p>
<p>I've had a hard time getting into the habits, such as doing time checks or questioning reality. When something weird happens I just accept it now. Because of this, I just started to accept that I would never be able to have a lucid dream. And besides, why would I need to have one? I can just use my imagination. The main reason people lucid dream instead of not is because it feels real, but how will I benefit from things feeling real if I convinced myself I lack emotion?</p>
<p>So, I've obviously given up hope for trying to lucid dream. But a few nights ago, I think it happened. I'm not sure if it actually did, because I don't think I was trying to control it. But everything that people usually describe that happens in their first lucid dream happened.</p>
<p>I don't know what was happening before the lucid part happened, but suddenly I was flying through the sky on a sunset. I was just taking in everything around me. I wasn't flying for any particular reason other than just to fly. And it was relaxing. After that, I tried summoning a hover bike, but I failed to do so.</p>
<p>After what was probably 3 minutes, suddenly a headset was taken off my head and the rest of the dream became an advertisement for the Apple headset thingy they're discontinuing. Kind of an underwhelming end, but whatever.</p>
