		<p>Another Tuesday that I have work on, another terribly formatted rant I wrote in 8 minutes.</p>
<p>I've reached the age where I honestly stopped caring about trends. That doesn't mean I ignore them or go out of my way to avoid them, but so much stuff just flies under my radar now and I don't care.</p>
<p>You know hawk tuah. And you may know the context, but I don't. All I know is the famous line. And to be honest, I don't have a reason to look up the full street interview. There are so many other examples that I could give. I don't know what a low taper fade is, what yns stands for, or what mango means.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think it's a little better this way. The lack of context adds some mystery to the words, images, and videos I see on my screen. You just kind of have to guess what's happening.</p>
<p>I realized that so far this has read somewhat like a stream of consciousness, so I want to talk about comment inside jokes. I despise these. Among small, niche audiences these can be funny, but when they spread to entire platforms they just become annoying.</p>
<p>If you don't know what I'm talking about, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>who is this DIVA ðŸ’œ</li>
<li>just put the fries in the bag</li>
<li>it gets tuah point</li>
<li>mama a girl behind you</li>
</ul>
<p>They're funny the first time you read them, but they start getting annoying quickly, because it's just the same joke, over and over again. You can predict the comment section before you open it, and it takes away from actually funny jokes or discussion.</p>
