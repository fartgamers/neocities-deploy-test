		<h1>Drawing the Same Things Over and Over Again</h1>

		<p>Drawing is something that I constantly want to get better at doing, but I never am able to. And I feel like this is partially my fault.</p>
<p>I've been actively into drawing for about 4 years now, but can I even say I'm actively drawing? It's been forever since I last actually drew something, and when I do I usually just draw <a href="/creative/characters/main.html" target="_blank">my character</a>. The only time I draw something else is during <a href="https://artfight.net" target="_blank">ArtFight</a>.</p>
<p>I want to make my own worlds, my own characters, but how am I supposed to make an entire world when I don't even have a name for the character I've been using for 4 years? I feel like my art could of gotten a lot better than it currently is if I would of drawn more drawings and drawn more unique things. But I don't. And when I actually try, I still don't. I just end up staring at a blank canvas, eventually either scribbling all over the canvas, or just writing out my stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>First off, one of my problems is that I work too fast, and expect things to just work out. Usually when I do something, I can make that happen. But for drawing, I cannot, as drawing is a skill that requires patience, which I don't have. After 30 minutes of doing something, I just have to move on. I know almost everyone is like this, but I have a hard time coming back to stuff. I have so many projects that I just abandoned, not because I wanted to, but because my brain told me it's time to move on.</p>
<p>My other issue is simply ideas. Coming up with ideas and choosing things is one of my biggest weaknesses. A year ago I was supposed to plan a vacation, and I still haven't picked a continent, yet alone a country, city, and attractions. I don't think that vacation is going to be happening. If you force me to pick something that I am passionate about to make, I probably won't be able to make it. The reason I love my character so much is that it shows that I was able to make something. But the thing is that I don't ever make any new characters. I just update the one I already have.</p>
<p>I have gotten better at art within 4 years, but I still cannot draw anything well outside of my character. And I'm frustrated about it. I want to change, I really do, but I just... can't.</p>
<p>Even with this blog, it feels like I have run out of things to say, so now I just rant about how I can't come up with ideas. I feel like I've written this post already. But what am I going to do about it? I don't doodle anymore, but I wish I would. I'm just waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does, especially when I have to be the one to make the change.</p>
