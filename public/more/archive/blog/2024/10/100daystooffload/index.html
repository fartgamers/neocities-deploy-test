		<h1>#100DaysToOffload</h1>
		<p>October 5, 2024</p>
		<p>I am looking at participating in <a href="https://100daystooffload.com" target="_blank">#100DaysToOffload</a>. This is a challenge where you publish 100 posts to your personal blog in a year.</p>
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>I have been wanting to get more into journaling and writing. I think doing this challenge would be a fun way to encourage myself to write more, outside of just my personal diary. I also rarely ever finish projects, so I think forcing myself to publish 100 blog posts within a year would be a fun way to try and complete a project.</p>
