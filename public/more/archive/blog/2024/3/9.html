<p>hi everyone. quick update this time. i made a little gizmo. last.fm has this <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/wiichicken/now" target="_blank">now playing view</a> that gets the job done, but i thought i could do better. so i made my own version that you can check out <a href="/interests/music/fm/playing.html" target="_blank">here</a>. it's still under construction, but im happy with how its coming along so far.</p>
