		<p><strong>alarma</strong>: i have changed the button for this site again. i'm really proud of this new button, i think it looks a lot better, is more updated (new domain), and conveys much more personality. now my little dude is doing more than just standing there, he's got a cool saw.<br>overall, im happy with the result, especially after 9 hours of work, but if you're not, you can still visit the <a href="/creative/graphics/buttons/index.html#home" target="_blank">buttons page</a> and download the old one.</p>
