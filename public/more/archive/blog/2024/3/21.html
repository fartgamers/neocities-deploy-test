		<p>awesome news! this site just reached 100 commits! that doesn't really mean anything specifically, because the size of a commit can vary, but it's still cool!<br>anyways, i have made some new improvements. pages now have a cool parallax effect when you scroll, as well as the background color of some pages changes as you scroll. the parallax effect is also disabled when you enable reduced motion, so that's awesome. here are a couple other changes i made:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>list and grid view for blog</li>
			<li>working on better theming</li>
			<li>breadcrumb navbar in music pages</li>
			<li>better code stability</li>
			<li>extremely small optimizations</li>
			<li>more organized archive with more content and better theming</li>
		</ul>
		<p>anyways, i don't have too much else to say. site updates may slow down for the next week and a half because i may end up on vacation, but we will have to see...</p>
