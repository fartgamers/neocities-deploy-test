		<h1>YouTube Gaming Recap 2024</h1>

		<p>YouTube itself has always had a strange relationship with gaming. Obviously gaming videos on YouTube are popular, but YouTube tries to push into gaming culture so hard you almost end up feeling bad for them.</p>
<p>For example, YouTube used to have a dedicated separate app for gaming, YouTube Gaming. This was shut down eventually as nobody used it, because why would you use a more limited version of YouTube? I suspect it was just a way to test UI changes before launching them.</p>
<p>Earlier this year YouTube launched <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/" target="_blank">Playables</a>, cheap browser games that you can play directly on YouTube, desktop or mobile. I'm willing to bet these are all from <a href="https://gamesnacks.com" target="_blank">Gamesnacks</a>, an obscure product from <a href="https://area120.google.com" target="_blank">Area 120</a>, which is a part of Google that just launches a bunch of products and shuts them all down 3 years later. If you think it's weird to open YouTube to play games, just ask Netflix.</p>
<p>For some reason everything now needs to have their own version of Spotify Wrapped. It's fun to look back on the year, but I feel like we don't need a Yelp Year in Review. YouTube decided to make one of these, but only for gaming content.</p>
<p>If you open the YouTube app and go to the &quot;You&quot; tab, you will find a button to launch a recap of your gaming activity this year. Not much about anything else in the app, just gaming videos. If you're wondering, this is what mine said:</p>
<h2>MY YouTube Gaming Recap 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>4.4% of my watch time was gaming</li>
<li>I watched videos about 9 different games this year</li>
<li>The game I watched the most this year was Minecraft</li>
<li>My top games of 2024 were
<ul>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Wii Sports</li>
<li>BeamNG.Drive</li>
<li>Club Penguin</li>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I jumped for the beef</strong>. I learned about the injustices of Parkour Civilization in evbo's epic series</li>
<li>I watched gaming videos from 6 creators</li>
<li>Evbo was my top gaming creator</li>
<li>I was in the top 0.9% of BeamngShorts fans</li>
<li>My top 5 gaming creators of 2024 were
<ul>
<li>Evbo</li>
<li>Bearman3600</li>
<li>videogamedunkey</li>
<li>Vargskelethor Joel</li>
<li>BeamngShorts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My gamer card is visionary. My creativity knows no bounds. I dive into projects with passion, turning empty spaces into thriving, imaginative worlds.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if it's not obvious, I don't really watch gaming videos, I don't really care. I zoned out once while a BeamNG.Drive short was playing, and they made the top 5, so that says something.</p>
<h2>Heading So You Know This Isn't The Same Section</h2>
<p>Honestly, this is fun, but why didn't they just make this about activity for the whole platform? If you aren't a gamer, you have nothing to share. Why did they launch this one so early?</p>
<p>The whole thing is stupid, but also funny.</p>
