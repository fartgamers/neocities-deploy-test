		<p>It's amazing how GPS is even accurate at all. Think about it. You're on a planet that is moving super fast, getting a signal from a satellite that is moving even faster. All that, and the most GPS is usually off by is about 9 feet. Sure, if you're in a city with large buildings the entire technology just stops working, but I think it's amazing just how accurate it is.</p>
<p>However, one thing that annoys me is when devices try making your location seem even more accurate than it is. There are two methods for this to work, one is good and one is bad.</p>
<p>The <strong>good</strong> method is using other sensors on your device to detect when you're moving and how far. This works really good because GPS still kinda works if you suddenly lose connection. A lot of turn by turn navigation applications use this for walking directions along with GPS because of the combined accuracy.</p>
<p>The <strong>bad</strong> method is faking your location by simply snapping you to roads and landmarks.</p>
<p>This has been a thing forever, and the only time it makes sense is for turn by turn navigation. If you're following a path, there is no reason to show you slightly off. You're not going to suddenly drive off the path and through someone's house, unless you off road. But if you're reading this blog I already know you don't.</p>
<p>Snapping your location to roads has been around forever, my 2005 Garmin GPS does it. And it made sense back then as GPS was nowhere near as accurate as they are today. But the thing is that the location isn't just faked on the maps, it's faked internally too. If you pull the GPS tracks off the device, you will see they're snapped onto the road.</p>
<p>The main thing that annoys me is some devices still do this. This can interfere with some applications, such as workout apps. The only time when it makes sense to snap the location on a mobile device is when doing turn by turn. Other uses can make measurements or coordinate sending harder. Yeah, it's not THAT far off, but you never know when you need an exact exact coordinate.</p>
