		<h1>Windows Cannot Toolbar</h1>

		<p>A few days ago I wrote an article about <a href="maximize.html">switching up my workflow</a> with how I use Windows. One thing I wanted to experiment with was the rarely used toolbars in the taskbar. They're a good idea in concept, but they just don't work.</p>
<p>Pinning a folder to the toolbar on Windows is different than on MacOS. On a Mac, you get a shortcut to the folder. Clicking it opens the folder in one of three views:</p>
<ul>
<li>List</li>
<li>Grid</li>
<li>List but fancy</li>
</ul>
<p>The main thing I like about this is quickly accessing files, for example screenshots. This is what I use ShareX for. However, I don't always want to open ShareX, so I decided to pin my screenshot folder to the taskbar.</p>
<p>It's useless, especially how I want to use it.</p>
<p>Maybe it has a few niche use cases (example a holding space), but it just doesn't work well. It's nice and compact (after changing a few basic settings) which I like, but useless otherwise. And that's entirely for one reason:</p>
<p><strong>You can't sort files</strong>.</p>
<p>Every file is forced to be in alphabetical order. No matter what you do, they will always be like this.</p>
<p>So, yeah, thank goodness this feature was removed in Windows 11, because nobody should ever have to suffer from it again.</p>
