		<h1>Breaking up With Maximizing</h1>

		<p>You don't frequently think about changing how you use your computer. However, about a week ago I tried something different, and so far I'm loving it.</p>
<p>For about as long as I could remember, I always used most windows maximized. Windows that I don't always  need my full attention on, for example chat windows and file explorer would remain restored down, but for the rest I would keep the full window maximized.</p>
<p>I think most Windows users use their computer like this, and for good reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You use the full available space for content</li>
<li>Your desktop isn't as cluttered</li>
<li>If you need to find a window, you can just use the taskbar</li>
</ul>
<p>And I don't blame people for using their computer like this. It's easy to understand, and works quite well.</p>
<p>The only time when most people use multiple windows at once is when they're trying to see things side by side, which they usually use the snap feature for. But even with this, desktop applications are adapting to making it so you don't need to do this. For example, web browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, and Arc all have a feature that let you view multiple pages side by side in the same window. I actually use these features frequently.</p>
<p>The main group of people who don't use their computer like this, however, are Mac users. This is most likely due to the way that MacOS handles maximizing a window, which I feel most people either don't like or don't want to get used to.</p>
<p>When you maximize a window on MacOS, the window takes up the <strong>entire</strong> screen, hiding the Dock and the menu bar (you can disable hiding the menu bar, but you have to remember most people just use the default settings). On top of that, the window control buttons are usually hidden, and appear in a way I think is very annoying to activate.</p>
<p>I had to start using MacOS for a college class, and I started to realize I prefer having each window floating. As such, I started using Windows this way, too.</p>
<h2>How I Adapted</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons for this is because of Discord. In <a href="discord.html" target="_blank">one of my previous articles</a>, I mention that the desktop Discord app doesn't show you have many unread messages you have in the app title, and I don't like desktop notifications. So, I started having Discord open in the corner of my screen. I mainly use one chat, so when I see the blue bar near the top of the Discord window, I know I have an unread message.</p>
<p>However, there have been a couple other things I like about this layout, too. Macs have bigger screens with a lot more pixels (the <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/" target="_blank">latest iMac</a> has a screen resolution of <code>4480x2520</code>, although Macs have a higher DPI). Because my monitor is only <code>1920x1080</code>, I didn't think I had enough screen space for this workflow. However, I quickly found that I adapted to the smaller window sizes. At the most, I had to hide things I didn't even need or use in the first place. These smaller windows have been nice too, because they allow better multitasking and I don't need to move my mouse as far to click things. Plus, one thing I have wished was a browser feature was changing the page margins, instead of using the ones set by the website's developer. But now that the window isn't taking up the full screen, I can just resize the window as I want.</p>
<p>Having a taskbar full of windows works well for me if I only have a few open, but when I start having a lot it becomes overwhelming and annoying to find them, especially when they aren't in the same order I expect. However, having them all on the screen with slight parts of them peeking out has made finding windows much easier. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ" target="_blank">Bumptop</a> recognized a long time ago that computers are too precise and organized that humans, imperfect beings, have a hard time adapting to them, so they wanted to bring the physical experience of a desk to the computer. Nobody uses Bumptop, but this reminds me of that. My desktop has become so disorganized that it just works.</p>
<p>Finally, another thing is that I just feel important with this desktop layout. And it works well with using <a href="monitor.html" target="_blank">a monitor</a>. I feel I have become more productive using this workflow because it's easier to find windows, and I'm reminded I can multitask, so I frequently drag stuff from window to window. Plus, seeing everything that I'm doing makes it easier to remember what I was doing if I get distracted.</p>
<h2>What I Had to Change</h2>
<p>There were a few things I decided to change to make this workflow work even better for me. Although I run Windows 11, I use <a href="https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher" target="_blank">ExplorerPatcher</a> to get the Windows 10 taskbar back, although I feel this will eventually be patched. The cool thing about the Windows 10 taskbar is that it has features, so I put it on the top of the screen (for some reason). I also use the small taskbar buttons option, because I don't need a huge taskbar. I also have the taskbar buttons centered on the screen, because I think it looks nice and is more comfortable to reach. The start button is still docked to the left side of the taskbar, because I like that consistent.</p>
<p>Windows 11 fairly recently added app labels back to the taskbar, but I don't like that implementation. On Windows 10, the app labels were all the same size. On Windows 11, the width of the app is based on the length of the label. Although this reduces how big apps with short labels are, windows where the title frequently changes causes the position of all the other apps on the taskbar to change, which is both annoying and distracting.</p>
<p>Finally, I use a few other customization apps. I use <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PF4KZ2VN4W9" target="_blank">TranslucentTB</a> from the Microsoft Store (ðŸ¤¢) because I like how the taskbar blends into my background. Although my background sucks, because its just a red and blue gradient. Finally, I use <a href="https://github.com/Oliviaophia/SmartTaskbar" target="_blank">SmartTaskbar</a>, which automatically hides the taskbar when an app is maximized, just like MacOS. You don't <em>have</em> to dislike every aspect of another operating system. However, the only app I have maximized is usually Visual Studio Code, which is always on my second monitor anyways.</p>
<p>I will have to see how long I end up keeping this workflow, or if I eventually move back to the old way. But currently, I'm quite happy with it.</p>
