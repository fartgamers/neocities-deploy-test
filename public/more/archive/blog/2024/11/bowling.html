		<h1>Unresearched Rant on if Bowling is Too Family Friendly</h1>

		<p>There aren't many third places in the United States of America, especially if you aren't in a major city. And the third places that do exist are usually attractions, not places that you frequently go to just to hang out. That's not to say these types of places don't exist in the USA, but they're few and far between.</p>
<p>One of the most popular types of attractions (based on no data, you read the title of this post) is bowling. Bowling is a fun, family friendly attraction. However, I feel like the entire bowling experience has gotten too family friendly, to the point where it's likely becoming a little annoying for bowling leagues.</p>
<p>First, when was the last time you saw a place dedicated to bowling? Usually bowling alleys have more than just bowling, which isn't a bad thing. You can have an arcade and some other stuff as an additional way to generate revenue, it makes perfect sense. However, I feel most places advertise themselves as &quot;fun centers&quot; rather than &quot;bowling alleys&quot;. They include so many extra things, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mini golf</li>
<li>Carnival rides</li>
<li>Go-karts</li>
<li>Full arcade with a ticket system</li>
<li>Laser tag</li>
<li>And probably more</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, this isn't necessarily bad to have more things to do, but for teams looking for bowling, this can likely be annoying. Having more things means less attention is given towards bowling. You can probably find a 3 lane alley in your local pub. That's not to say that is always happening, different places are owned by different people, but it's usually the case.</p>
<p>Another thing, and I think this is the big thing, are the scoring systems and computers used. I think the biggest sign of this are the animations that play after you take a turn.</p>
<p>A lot of people have the idea that bowling animations are freaky and surreal stuck in their minds. People have even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70p3S7MS2U0" target="_blank">made parodies</a> of these animations. And while technology improving has been a bigger factor of this, the animations aren't like this anymore. Now, they're much less likely to be unnerving, and some even include features such as inserting cutouts of player faces into the animations. For the most part, they're inoffensive and safe, which is funny because the animations already were like this.</p>
<p>And speaking of the machines, there are so many features now that its a little overwhelming for people who don't frequently bowl. There are companion apps, accounts, themes, different game modes, and location integrations such as ordering. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the machines could blow you (air conditioning, obviously <img src="/media/emoji/smirk.gif" alt="smirk">) These aren't bad features necessarily, but in my opinion it feels like they're trying to do what Top Golf did to golf (made it appeal to non-golfers). However, bowling already appeals to most people, so it makes you wonder what the point was.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you wanted a conclusion, ask somebody who actually goes bowling more than twice a year.</p>
