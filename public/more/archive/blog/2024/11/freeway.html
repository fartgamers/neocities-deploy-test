		<p>I have a bad habit of speeding. First off, I live in Michigan, so speeding is the norm. As long as you aren't pulling a MKBHD (going 105 in a children's zone), you can probably get away with going 15 over the speed limit and still have people honk at you for going too slow.</p>
<p>I previously rarely had to drive, because I could just walk everywhere. But that is no longer the case. So I must drive. I tend to take the scenic route because it feels like I'm in Tokyo drift, except I'm in a neighborhood. If I'm feeling risky, I will take backroads instead.</p>
<p>I have been avoiding the freeway for quite some time now. It's scary and it's boring. However, Apple CarPlay decided to kill itself one day so I had to use the physical GPS which has maps from 2008. And that made me take the freeway. I knew my way, but I decided why not.</p>
<p>The first day was alright I guess. Once I got off, my car started making a loud noise. I looked it up and it just does that if it's been a long time since it's gone fast. So yeah. It hasn't done it since then.</p>
<p>In the morning, the freeway tends to be more efficient, but only sometimes in the afternoon. You spend so long waiting at traffic lights before you can get on you don't save any time. And I realized that people drive slow on it, for some reason. I usually end up just going 55 because I'm stuck behind cars that don't wanna go fast. And I hate merging! I still hesitate when making pull requests 100 of them later, so I just avoid merging in person too.</p>
<p>The main thing I don't like about the freeway is how boring it is. You're just looking at straight road. There aren't any curves or anything interesting other than billboards. It reminds me of faceless YouTube channels. You aren't doing it for the love of the game, you're doing it for efficiency.</p>
<p>Overall, driving 70 miles an hour in a minivan is fun, but driving on random roads is even more fun. So I don't know what I will do.</p>
