				<ul>
					<li>there is a new list on the list page</li>

					<li>any death grips cover arts are now automatically censored on the index page's now playing widget. yeah</li>
				</ul>
				<p>honestly, sorry about not having as many updates recently. graduating and working is annoying. plus, i have to go on vacation to north michigan tomorrow. what am i even going to do there? hunt? <img src='/media/emoji/unamused.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''><br>but in all seriousness, thank you guys for continuing to look at this project that i call my own <img src='/media/emoji/grin.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''>.</p>

				<p>another sunday, another site update. now that i think about it, why don't i just compile all these site updates into one page? actually, thats a good idea. this is what is new:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>what i just said</li>
					<li>you can now input your username on the <a href="/interests/music/fm/playing.html" target="_blank">last.fm now playing page</a></li>
					<li>uploaded just a little new art. go me!</li>
					<li>sections and blogs are no longer in the directory, but on <a href="/interests/websites/reading.html" target="_blank">their own page</a></li>
					<li>i just discovered border-box, and let's just say i've gone pro (this doesn't affect you)</li>
					<li>i made a userscript that replaces all the X "Post" buttons across the web with "Tweet" buttons. <a href="/more/tools/userscripts/tweetbutton.html" target="_blank">check it out</a></li>

					<h3>DO YOU HATE ME YET?</h3>
					<p>April 28, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>We swept under the rug, dusted the pottery, and squashed some bugs. For the best experience, make sure your app is always up to date.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>added the original version of my late 2023 site redesign to the <a href="/more/archive/websites/homepages/index.html" target="_blank">website archive</a>. my goal was to kind of keep the design how it was at the start for subpages, but that clearly hasn't happened.</li>
					<li>fixed a bug where the navbar just didn't work. like at all. i think it's fixed. i HOPE its fixed</li>
					<li>much better noscript support. indicators of pages that won't work will appear when no javascript is available, as well as lots of elements that don't work with javascript will just vanish. i still have some work to do, but the experience isn't too compromising yet</li>
					<li>added what the kids call a shrine, but in reality its just a wiki that has 3 pages and none of them are finished</li>
					<li>do you like how on the homepage links have an underline instead of a highlight? no? well too bad, im adding this to more pages. this definitely doesn't go against my philosophy of "don't update the design of old pages"</li>
				</ul>
				<p>also, we hit 50 followers on neocities! that is cool i think, but followers dont matter. but hey, thanks anyways! to celebrate, this update log will be in a slight yellow</p>

					<h3>WELL, THAT HAPPENED</h3>
					<p>April 21, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>something happened, and i accidentally pushed the work in progress version of the site on thursday, instead of sunday. my bad. oh well, i guess you get a little sneak peak. anyways, here are the changes that i made:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>new <a href="/interests/websites/graveyard.html" target="_blank">graveyard</a> for websites that no longer exist in the directory</li>
					<li>photography page is now a thing. im not happy with it, sorry. <img src='/media/emoji/down.gif' loading='lazy'></li>
					<li>flood widget changed. instead of draining the flood, you fill it</li>
					<li>dude, i dont know</li>
				</ul>
				<p>dshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>

					<h3>STAGGERiNG</h3>
					<p>April 14, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>i am now experimenting with making updates live at the end of the week, instead of with every commit. timely content like blog posts will still be published when they happen, but things like new pages, layout updates, features, and whatever won't be updated until the end of the week.<br>anyways, this is what is new this week:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>button directory has new views; list, button, and large button. please use them. it took forever to add and was really boring.</li>
					<li>each top level page now has its gradient displayed in the favicon. i will add more pages to this later.</li>
					<li>clicking the home button while on the homepage now scrolls to the top of the page. fun.</li>
					<li>most pages should still slightly work, even if you have javascript disabled. how long i will continue to provide support for people living in 1996, i dunno!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>also, i hit 50,000 hits! woohoo! i am so thankful that there are people online who are willing to look at my goofy website. so, i would just like to say, thank you <img src="/media/emoji/rofl.gif" loading="lazy"></p>

					<h3>NEW BUTOTN AGAIN</h3>
					<p>March 29, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p><strong>alarma</strong>: i have changed the button for this site again. i'm really proud of this new button, i think it looks a lot better, is more updated (new domain), and conveys much more personality. now my little dude is doing more than just standing there, he's got a cool saw.<br>overall, im happy with the result, especially after 9 hours of work, but if you're not, you can still visit the <a href="/creative/graphics/buttons/index.html" target="_blank">buttons page</a> and download the old one.</p>

					<h3>100</h3>
					<p>March 21, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>awesome news! this site just reached 100 commits! that doesn't really mean anything specifically, because the size of a commit can vary, but it's still cool!<br>anyways, i have made some new improvements. pages now have a cool parallax effect when you scroll, as well as the background color of some pages changes as you scroll. the parallax effect is also disabled when you enable reduced motion, so that's awesome. here are a couple other changes i made:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>list and grid view for blog</li>
					<li>working on better theming</li>
					<li>breadcrumb navbar in music pages</li>
					<li>better code stability</li>
					<li>extremely small optimizations</li>
					<li>more organized archive with more content and better theming</li>
				</ul>
				<p>anyways, i don't have too much else to say. site updates may slow down for the next week and a half because i may end up on vacation, but we will have to see...</p>

					<h3>newGizmo</h3>

				</header>
				<p>hi everyone. quick update this time. i made a little gizmo. last.fm has this <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/wiichicken/now" target="_blank">now playing view</a> that gets the job done, but i thought i could do better. so i made my own version that you can check out <a href="/interests/music/fm/playing.html" target="_blank">here</a>. it's still under construction, but im happy with how its coming along so far.</p>

					<h3>EL DiRECTORY</h3>
					<p>Feburary 16, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>I have given the website directory a huge update. Not only is there now a ton more links, but there are also work in progress pages for browsers and iOS apps (include sideloaded ones). I am working on expanding the page slowly but surely, but so far I'm proud of how it's came along.<br>As an experimental way of featuring sites, I have also launched "Site of the fiscal period", which is actually just updated whenever I feel like it. It's just a way for me to feature sites that I think you should check out. I don't know how this will go along with buttons and favicons on the homepage, but I don't think about anything.<br>So, anyways, I'm just working on adding more and more stuff. I think next I will work on adding doodles and stuff to the art page, I don't know yet. I might also start committing less, but still updating the site alot.<br>That is all I have to say for now. Remember to complete your daily Wordle.</p>

					<h3>SAME SH!T, NOW ON GiT</h3>
					<p>February 4, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>Sorry about the title, that rhyme was too good not to include.<br>Version control using Git on my site is now working. This shouldn't mean anything to you, the viewer, but it means a lot to me. This is what I had to do before in order to update my site:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Update each page</li>
					<li>Remember what pages I updated</li>
					<li>Navigate to each folder in Neocities, click upload, find the same folder on my hard drive</li>
					<li>Copy and paste the changes for each page into Neocities</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now, this is all I need to do:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Update each page</li>
					<li>Click commit (basically publish)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So yeah, I am very excited about this, especially after all of the trial and error that I went through to get to this point.<br>This will also allow me to use packages, which could make my site better. I tried using eleventy, but I had too many pages to remake, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of remaking all of them.</p>

					<h3>whereAmI</h3>
					<p>January 22, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>It's really obvious that navigation and consistency on my site is really poor. So today, I added a navbar that I will slowly be rolling out to all pages.<br>If you scroll down, you will now see a navbar with links to what I think are good top level pages. The navbar isn't on all pages yet, but it's on the important ones. If you're on mobile, the navbar should be replaced with a sidebar. I am working on making the button less in the way.<br>Anyways, some side pages have also been updated design wise. Woo-hoo.<br>This site recently hit 25,000 hits and 25 Neocities followers, which is cool. Thanks! I didn't expect this site to really take off, but I guess not abondoning a site does that to you.</p>

					<h3>TRENDY LAYOUT</h3>
					<p>January 13, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>After much work, I have finally upgraded the layout of not only the homepage, but also for once, the music page! Yay!<br>The new homepage looks amazing, I think. I decided to use the trendy bento layout, and it makes the page feel so much more dynamic. The only thing I don't like is now the signature glow is gone, only on the header.<br>Not much else to say. I need a break, man.</p>

					<h3>THE NEW NEW</h3>
					<p>January 9, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>I showed this website to one of my classes, and listened carefully to what they said. Here are some highlights of what they said:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This is cool</li>
					<li>WAIT THE CLOCK MOVES? THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL. but the hands are off doe.</li>
					<li>This is really overwhelming</li>
					<li>Why are so many images blocked?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So I want to take this feedback into consideration when updating the site. I also found that most people started with the widgets first and then moved onto the body of the page. I may try deemphasizing the widgets, but who knows.<br>Anyways, I am going through a new era of design now, kinda. You may of noticed that I added subtle blur effects behind some elements on the homepage and increased padding. Yep, I'm doing that. I also added a sticky navbar that appears when you start scrolling. Currently it doesn't really do much, although it does have a scroll to top button, but you can't really tell that. I'm kind of proud of how the bar looks, I just don't know what to put on it quite yet.<br>Anyways, this concludes this yap. Happy new year, and make sure to give us a 5 star review on Yelp.</p>
