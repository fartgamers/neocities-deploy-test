					<h2>The Carnival Where They Break Your Dreams</h2>
					<p>in my dream, the circus came to my school. they did their whole thing, and then had us all do our individual activities. once we did an individual activity, the perosn hosting it would straight up drive away and leave.<br>later on, there were a bunch of minigames. there was one where you had to climb to the top of an impossible thing to grab a thing and get a reward. i did this, and so did another person.<br>the announcer was calling out who won it, and said that the other person won. the whole crowd started cheering out that i won. so he started making us do things like riding on each other. eventually, one of the people organizing the event said "this is not on script, stick to the script"</p>

					<h2>the worlds saddest childrens song</h2>
					<p>my dream was like a weird children's music video that had various abstract shapes running around and performing random actions. one of the shapes was put behind bars, but came back out a few lines later in the song. the shapes were doing things like going down a slide, which they would be chopped up by the end of the slide for some reason.<br>eventually i suddenly woke up, and for some reason i was just about to cry from this dream. the only lyric that i remember is:</p>
					<blockquote>5, 6, 7, 8, where did you get that mug?</blockquote>

					<h2>hotel water park</h2>
					<p>august 3, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream we went to a hotel with a water park.<br>there was a booth where you could promote your own work. one kid was doing something with his ocs, and me and my friends through it was so funny we befriended them. my mom wanted to go in the river with boats that had cool lights, but comedically right after she said that, the waterpark staff said "goodnight!" over the intercom and then shut it off.<br>the next day, we came back and one of my managers was there. she said "new policy: if any customers drop their fries, they're dead." later, i came back and she was pointing a pistol at the head of a child eating a small fry, she was about 2 feet away. one of the employees was like "please drop the fry, please drop the fry!"<br>anyways, i grabbed a laptop and microsoft added a feature to windows 10 where you could theme yourself, and it would show your theme in the taskbar. for some reason, everyone but my mom left the indoor pool, so i started jumping around really high, almost to the point where i could touch the ceiling</p>

					<h2>the edge of michigan</h2>
					<p>july 27, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream, me and my irl friends were all going to go on a motorcycle and drive to the edge of michigan on a secret trip. we stopped at a random cabin in the middle of the woods and started pirating music. the catch was that you had to complete a pixel art color by number in order to make the download commence</p>

					<h2>the kid from the game</h2>
					<p>july 4, 2023</p>
					<p>i was playing this really crappy open world game that had a ton of bugs and i was just driving random places. eventually, i found this kid and we started talking about the different types of maps that different gear had. we started travelling together and he was going to show me how purchasing land worked in the game, so he took me to his house. suddenly, the game just became a gps and then it became real life once i arrived at his house.<br>he let me into his house and i was really nervous, so i started speaking through the text to speech on my phone. one of the things he said to me was "you wanna wait a little bit to get the full effect of spongebob 69s" (this was a codename for peeing). his house was quite clean and furnished, but there were like 9999 airsoft guns on his patio. also, the kitchen door had sensors that would detect wheneevr someone went in or out of them, and display it on a counter. it said 11 people were in the kitchen, but that was not true.<br>eventually, the kid started telling me about the time he almost died. i wasn't paying attention to his story because i was too busy looking at how many copies of Minecraft Handbook: Redstone Edition that he had.<br>eventually, my grandma walked in and was like "insane how we got here, huh?" and i pulled up openstreetmap and it said that we were in grand rapids (the in game map thing from earlier had us in backroads)</p>

					<h2>bed bath and beyond our timeline</h2>
					<p>march 1, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream stores started getting worker robots which were just blue magnetic floor tiles with wheels and a camera. they would drive around and sometimes try to trip you, forcing you to pay attention, and if the algorithm went off, they would grab you and carry you somewhere</p>
