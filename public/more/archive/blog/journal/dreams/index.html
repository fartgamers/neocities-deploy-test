			<h2>The Carnival Where They Break Your Dreams</h2>
			<p>in my dream, the circus came to my school. they did their whole thing, and then had us all do our individual activities. once we did an individual activity, the perosn hosting it would straight up drive away and leave.<br>later on, there were a bunch of minigames. there was one where you had to climb to the top of an impossible thing to grab a thing and get a reward. i did this, and so did another person.<br>the announcer was calling out who won it, and said that the other person won. the whole crowd started cheering out that i won. so he started making us do things like riding on each other. eventually, one of the people organizing the event said "this is not on script, stick to the script"</p>
