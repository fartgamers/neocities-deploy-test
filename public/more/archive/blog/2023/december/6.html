    <p>I made a guesbook, finally! If you would like to sign my guestbook, use the link that can be found on the sidebar. I may eventually switch what I am using for the guestbook, but for right now I am using 123guestbook or whatever it's called.<br>You may have noticed that my visitor count and last updated widgets broke. Oops! I think I have successfully replaced the visitor count widget, however, I have not replaced the widget for the last updated page. Also, there is now a credits page on the sidebar, because I know not everyone is checking the source code for the comments containing credits.<br>Don't really have much else to say.</p>
