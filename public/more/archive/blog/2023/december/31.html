<p id="updatedate">December 31, 2023</p>
<p>Well, we finally did it. After suddenly remembering that I have a job, I have finally purchased a domain. I settled on wiggle.monster because it's really funny and tells you nothing about the site. I haven't updated any part of the sites layout at all, so everything still says wiichicken.neocities.org. At least when Twitter "rebranded", they changed the logo!<br>Also, just in time for New Years, I have added a new years countdown to the top of the site! Now instead of spending time with your family, you can spend time with me! Just kidding, don't actually do that. I just included the countdown for fun.<br>Anyways, not much else to say. Have a happy new years, and remember to spend time with family and food.</p>
