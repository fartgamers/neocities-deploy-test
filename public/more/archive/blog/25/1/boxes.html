		<p>I would consider myself a hoarder. Not an extreme hoarder, but a hoarder nonetheless. Luckily, I rarely ever purchase anything, so I don't have much to hoard. But the few things I do have, I hoard.</p>
<p>Boxes are one of those things. I don't hoard every single box that I get, but I would say I keep about half of them. A lot of people keep Apple product boxes, which I cannot blame them. They are good boxes to have. But there are so many more boxes than just Apple boxes that you can keep.</p>
<p>I can always appreciate a good box. There is just something about a high quality box that I can appreciate, that makes me want to make it apart of my family. Boxes of all shapes and sizes count, but usually medium sized plastic or especially cardboard ones are selected.</p>
<p>Previously, I just had all my boxes rot away in a corner, but I think it's time for a change. The cool thing about boxes is that you can put stuff inside of them. And even though you have taken stuff out of the boxes previously, you can put new stuff inside them and use boxes for organization.</p>
<p>So, that's what I think I'm going to do. I don't know how or what I'm going to be putting inside of these boxes. But boxes, just know you're about to take on a new life. Your time to shine is <strong>now</strong>.</p>
