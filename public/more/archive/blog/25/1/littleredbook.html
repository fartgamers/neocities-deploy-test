		<h1>Goodbye TikTok... Hello 小红书!</h1>

		<p>Never in my life did I think I would write a second article about Xiaohongshu, yet here I am.</p>
<p>In protest of the TikTok ban, a lot of American users are moving to Xiaohongshu. I will be calling it &quot;little red book&quot;, because that's what the name translates to, as well as what everyone is calling it. And it seems like the staff of little red book have been welcoming, as the CEO even made a welcome video for Americans.</p>
<p>The hardest part about the whole thing has probably been cultural differences and the lack of app translations. Not only does little red book not have a built in translation feature, but most of the app isn't translated into English either. This isn't too much of a problem, as most people have basic app structure memorized.</p>
<p>In terms of the Chinese users, they seem to not really mind it. Some don't want Americans to bring politics to the platform, but the current group of people on little red book don't seem to be doing any of that. In fact most of the content is edits, art, and thirst traps. The Chinese users seem to be posting memes, as well as teaching Mandarin to English users. It's a little sweet.</p>
<p>I feel about a week after the TikTok ban takes place (if it does), the platform will die down with English users. But until then, this is certainly something.</p>
