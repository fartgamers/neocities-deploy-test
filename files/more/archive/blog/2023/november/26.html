    <p id="updatedate">November 26, 2023</p>
    <p>I suddenly remembered this site exists, so I decided that I wanted to make it look good. The old design was good, but it didn't really convey much personality, and the colors didn't really go well. I also didn't like how this site was basically just a linktree with some other pages on it. So, I'm working to change that!<br>A day ago, I completely redesigned the homepage, with a new look, design and premise. It is still a work in progress, but I think it looks nice. Here are a few things that are new:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Buttons</strong> - I now have a button that you can add to your website. I am also working on adding buttons for other sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Widgets</strong> - My 10 most recent scrobbles from last.fm are now shown on the homepage. You can click on them to see a full widget showing track titles. My only concern is potentially NSFW or bad taste cover arts being displayed, but I think the images are small enough where that is not an issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Logo</strong> - I now have a logo! It's not the best, but I'm kinda happy with how it turned out.</li>
        <li><strong>Theme</strong> - This homepage now has an aquamarine and red/blue gradient theme, which I think looks really nice. Potentially, you will be able to change these in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, what's next? First, I still have much more theming to do. Only really the main page and a subpage that I haven't even linked to yet have updated theming. Not everything needs to be themed, but I think at least the important pages should be. Next, I want more content to be on my website. Maybe that be uploading more games, or art, I don't know yet. I might also experiment with frame navigation, but that probably won't happen. Finally, I want a fake chat assistant on the site, to make fun of companies that say they use "AI" when in reality they just use an algorithm.<br>Well, that's it for my first update! See you eventually!</p>
