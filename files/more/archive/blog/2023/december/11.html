<p>I finally added my first collection of art that I made to my homepage! I am starting out with my collection of wallpapers that I made for my phone.

To make the homepage less dull, I have also added an art section to it. I think it looks kinda nice, I think.<br>I have also made a couple other adjustments to this site. I realized that the increment button was slightly off, so I fixed that. I am also apart of a webring.<br>Now if you excuse me, I have to get back to fighting <i>Peter Griffin</i> in <i>Fortnite: Battle Royale</i>.</p>
