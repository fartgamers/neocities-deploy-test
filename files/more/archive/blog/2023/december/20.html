<h2 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">REDUCED MOTiON</h2>
<p id="updatedate">December 20, 2023</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about how 2.2 is out now, but the real thing people should be talking about is how I just dropped a really rushed reduced motion mode on this site.<br>Currently, only the homepage is optimized, but if you visit this site with reduced motion enabled on your device, most of the transitions, animations, and effects will be disabled. I am still working on some small changes, for example, user buttons just display as regular links, but I want them to display instead as static, non-animated images. Also, some transitions still play, like the macOS style magnifier effect when you hover over the navbar.<br>Overall, this is still a good start, and I'm hoping that in the near future this mode will become more fleshed out (probably not, because I am lazy).<br>Also, the interests/media page has a new look, and I am working on adding more glow effects throughout the site. There is also a little pet thingy on the homepage, don't know what that's all about.<br>Anyways, if you excuse me, I have to get back to playing VVVVVV on the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
