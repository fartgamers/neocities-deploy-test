    <h1>SAME SH!T, NOW ON GiT</h1>

  <p>Sorry about the title, that rhyme was too good not to include.<br>Version control using Git on my site is now working. This shouldn't mean anything to you, the viewer, but it means a lot to me. This is what I had to do before in order to update my site:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Update each page</li>
    <li>Remember what pages I updated</li>
    <li>Navigate to each folder in Neocities, click upload, find the same folder on my hard drive</li>
    <li>Copy and paste the changes for each page into Neocities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now, this is all I need to do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Update each page</li>
    <li>Click commit (basically publish)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So yeah, I am very excited about this, especially after all of the trial and error that I went through to get to this point.<br>This will also allow me to use packages, which could make my site better. I tried using eleventy, but I had too many pages to remake, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of remaking all of them.</p>
