<h2 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">TRENDY LAYOUT</h2>
<p id="updatedate">January 13, 2024</p>
<p>After much work, I have finally upgraded the layout of not only the homepage, but also for once, the music page! Yay!<br>The new homepage looks amazing, I think. I decided to use the trendy bento layout, and it makes the page feel so much more dynamic. The only thing I don't like is now the signature glow is gone, only on the header.<br>Not much else to say. I need a break, man.</p>
