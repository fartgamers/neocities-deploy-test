these are old websites that i have made over the years. most of these are archives of sites made with site creation tools, recreated with html (not very well)

- [Google Sites](gsites/) - bad recreations of googles sites i made during a more simple time
- [homepage archive](homepages/) - archive of this site you're on right now!
