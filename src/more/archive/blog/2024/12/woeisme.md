I'm not trying to be an asshole, but there is nothing that I hate more than seeing e-couples on the timeline. On one hand, I'm happy that you found "love". But on the other hand, holy crap are you annoying.

## the part where i try being funny

E-couples love to force themselves to reply to everything the other person wrote, even when they have nothing to say. The conversation usually ends the same too every time. I'm not saying that couples can't reply to each other, but give it a break.

Next, they love matching profile pictures. I know, its intimate or whatever, but we can't tell you apart from each other. It was cute the first time, but now you're just being annoying. We all know you're going to change it in a week.

## woe is me

But the reason I hate online couples and their wacky tactics is because it reminds me of how alone that I really am. I know people in real life, but I rarely talk to them. The only time I really interact with people is at work.

It's reaching a point where I start getting emotionally attached to anybody who gives me attention, and then getting scared and isolating myself.

I am an uninteresting person, and I don't even have friends, yet alone ever had a lover. There have only been two times I would consider someone having a crush on me:

- In middle school some girl would laugh at every joke I made, no matter how terrible. She tried flirting with me but she kept sending me iMessage features and Snapchat links that I couldn't read because I was using a Kyocera flip phone.
- In High School some girl took my phone to add her Snapchat. I was connected to school Wi-Fi so that didn't work, because the school blocked Snapchat for obvious reasons. She was later sent to the physc ward.

I don't want to see any of it because I am reminded of myself.
