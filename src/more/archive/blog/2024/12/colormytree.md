Last year, people started posting links to a website where you write messages to people under a virtual tree, and then open them on Christmas day. This year I decided to participate in that, however I used a service called *Color my Tree* because it didn't have Temu ads.

*If you wrote a message for me and I mainly know you from a social media, chances are I already replied on said social network. Scroll through my profile, or if you cannot find it try searching for your username. But for everyone, I'm also going to be putting my replies here.*
