Do most people actually enjoy making holiday cookies and decorating them?

It's fun for like 15 minutes, but once you realize you have to decorate like 80 of these things, it stops being fun and starts being a chore. And maybe this is because I have always used frosting and decorations that are... crap, but decorating is just annoying. Frosting comes out too slow and never goes where you want it to go.

Granted, a lot of the fun of decorating a Christmas cookie is making an abomination that you will be ashamed of for many years to come. Either that, or just spreading a layer of frosting on top, maybe adding some sprinkles, and calling it good enough.

Decorating gingerbread houses is better anyways. When you decorate a gingerbread house, you're making a home and telling a story with said home. Plus  you have room to actually make something nice. When you're decorating cookies, you have a much smaller canvas, and you're not on as creative of a canvas. You can maybe make characters, but there is no story to tell. You may have cookies that are cut into specific shapes, but they're so abstract meaning is lost. I made a skull cookie and a black cat cookie this year for Christmas and **nobody** questioned the random Halloween themes.

Instead of decorating cookies this holiday season, start having a competition of who can make the funniest Fortnite joke with your family instead.
