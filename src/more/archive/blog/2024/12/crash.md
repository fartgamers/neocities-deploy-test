[A few articles ago](../11/winter.html) I was talking about how easy that it is to drive in the snow. I guess I forgot my own advice, because yesterday I slid into a metal pole and took out my left rear view mirror. The whole thing is completely damaged, with the glass dangling off of it. Oops!

This is how it went down. Basically I was about to make a left, however I was going too fast, and the ice was causing me to be unable to brake. I didn't want to end up in a ditch, so I quickly just swerved back into the road, resulting in only side swiping the left rear view mirror, which destroyed it. I'm happy that's all that was damaged.

A lot of people talk about how the music doesn't stop when you get into a crash, and I can confirm that. The music indeed didn't stop. However, with how focused (or "locked in" as the kids say) I became, the music might as well of stopped. If you're wondering, the song that was playing was **Vintage Doms by Domo Genesis**, around the 40 second mark.

So, thankfully I'm going to be getting a replacement mirror, however it's going to cost a little under `$200`, which is less than ideal, but nothing too bad. I was expecting it to cost at least a thousand, because I hear car stuff is expensive.

Something I feel I could have done better to prevent this in the future is slow down, especially when it's snowing. It didn't look like there was barely any snow out when this happened, which made me lower my guard, and that's definitely what got me.
