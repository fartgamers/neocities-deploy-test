Maybe it's because I don't go shopping much at all, but I really hate shopping online.

To begin, I am thankful of the things online shopping has given us. For example, I am happy that I can purchase almost whatever I want, even if stores or people in my area aren't selling it. And I understand that not everyone always has the ability to just go to a store. Online shopping is a good innovation.

Despite the convenience that online shopping brings, I still don't like it.

I like being able to interact with a product before I purchase it. I need to know what my actual experience with it will be like. Reviews can not only be faked, but may not cover the specifics I want. And people aren't good at leaving reviews. Most reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars, maybe with a 3 thrown in there.

This is especially true for big or expensive purchases. I need to see it to believe it. The majority of purchases I make online are somewhat expensive, so this is especially annoying.

Next, online payment is annoying. Usually if Apple Pay or PayPal isn't an acceptable payment option, I don't want to purchase whatever you're selling. I just don't like typing in my credit card information into a field, no matter how secure you say it is (or actually is).

Finally, delivery is a pain in the butt. Tracking orders is messy, and nobody has fixed this. Apple has a tool for order tracking built into the Wallet app, and not even purchases from Apple support it. And the estimated delivery date is always wrong. Packages will sometimes come an entire week before the expected date. And signing packages is annoying. Why are you expecting an adult to be at a house at 3 PM on a Wednesday?

I'm happy that online shopping is a thing, but I still try to avoid it.
