I've hit a lot of milestones over the past almost year. I went from `10,000` hits on this website to almost `200,000`. I've made a bunch of pages, including a handful of projects that I'm a little proud of. I have even become friends with a couple webmasters.

However, about a month ago I got a guestbook comment. This was a very unusual, but eventually expected comment. The comment was from the author "reggin". This sounds like a normal name at first, until you look at it backwards, and realize it's the n-word! Yikes!

But here's the thing. About 2 hours ago, I got a message from someone who set their name and message to the n-word! No effort was put into the message. "This will get them good! They're going to be so angry!" was probably what the author thought.

Nobody puts effort into trolling anymore. All they know is n-word, swastika, copypasta, and current trend. Either that or put as many edgy things into one message. But the thing they don't realize is the more edgy you try to be, the less edgy you actually appear as.

Honestly, I'm a little shocked how long it took for me to start getting trolls on my guestbook. I have been getting a lot of them recently, however I have also been getting a lot more lovely messages, so I cannot complain. Trolls are apart of the internet experience.

Remember kids, you don't even have to block trolls, just mute them. They strive for all the attention they can get, so not giving them any is the best thing you can do.
