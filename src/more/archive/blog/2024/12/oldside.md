I remember about a month ago I saw a video on TikTok that said "Go outside, it's still 2009". I would try and find the video, however I am writing this blog post in a car, and I don't have a SIM card in my laptop.

In one case, this is true, especially if you don't live in a large city or even medium sized city. But on the other hand, things have subtly changed, and we don't even realize it.

First, if you're in North America, it's more than likely you're driving. There are 3 main things that change that date a drive:

- Buildings (this one not as much)
- Signage
- Billboards (which is the same as signage, but different enough to be its own category)

Buildings don't really matter, because they're built to last for tens of years. You can see buildings from many years and never even realize it. However, buildings also get remodeled, and new buildings usually have newer design styles.

In Michigan, these new buildings are usually cannabis shops, and half of them have really modern designs. They look like that one house in Pleasant Park (that's a Fortnite joke). And they have bright, neon green futuristic lights. These wouldn't be a big deal if there weren't many of them, but there are so many.

Next, the actual reason I wrote this blog post, signage. When making the signs, the Makers did a really good job at making good signs that are pretty timeless. The design of road signs hasn't changed much since the 70s, and there isn't a reason for them to change. Most of them work, look nice, and have a timeless design.

That's not to say the design of road signs hasn't changed. Depending on the state that you're in, the signs use a different font. Also, on freeways most electronic highway signs are similar. Dot matrix (I think) displays with orange letters are usually used. If you're on a toll road, maybe there is an actual screen, but this is all you get.

Finally, there are billboards. The thing about billboards is instead of having ads for Things, the ads are for local businesses. So unless you're seeing an ad for McDonald's, you're likely seeing the cheesy local ads. With that said, the design of said ads has definitely gotten more flat. However, if you're looking at ads, you're looking at the wrong things, especially on the highway.

If you're driving, it does feels like you're on Twitter at the start of the rebrand. Some things are modern, and some things are old. The only places that feel old are small cities, and this is intentional.
