I used to use a full Razer mouse with RBG and stuff. I got tired of the RGB within a week and mainly liked it for the macros and extra buttons (which were honestly awesome).  However, quite literally the week the warranty expired the mouse just stopped working. No matter what kind of device I plug it into, the mouse cannot be recognized. What fun.

After that, I started using a ThinkPad branded wireless mouse. I liked this because there was also a keyboard with it, and they both looked cool. It was a basic mouse, but it worked, and it did its job well. However, I started experiencing some issues with it, mainly related to scrolling. If I tried scrolling up, it would either scroll down or do nothing, depending on the mood.

Because I don't feel like getting a new mouse, I decided to use an Apple Magic Mouse that my kleptomaniac friend gave me for some reason (wonder where he got it from). Of course, I use Windows, and the Magic Mouse isn't made for Windows, so there would be some issues.

When you first connect the Magic Mouse, you have to install drivers for it to enable scrolling. You cannot just download the drivers, you have to download the whole boot camp kit from Apple. However, once you have it downloaded you can choose to only install the mouse drivers.

Once you have the mouse drivers, you will realize that on Windows it isn't really a "magic" mouse. The only real beneficial feature it has is the ability to scroll horizontally in a way that isn't weird, which I actually quite like a lot. However, gestures and stuff won't work.

There is a piece of software you can purchase called Magic Mouse Utilities, which allows you to give the mouse additional functionality. I tried the demo and it worked great, but I don't want to pay a subscription for mouse features, or constantly have another program running in the background.

Although the scrolling is great, there is no momentum, so it just suddenly stops once you lift your finger. Don't think there is anything you can really do about this. Another annoying thing is that there is no middle click, and you cannot left and right click at the same time. This doesn't sound like too big of a deal until you have to actually live with it.

Another thing is that the mouse is weirdly shaped, and so you have to hold it in a weird way compared to other mice. It's not bad, but it's something you have to get used to. Instead of having my entire hand on the whole thing, my thumb and ring fingers supporting the mouse on the sides, and my index, middle, and pinkie fingers hovering in the air.

Because of how much glass or translucent material is on the top of the mouse, you can see any gunk that gets on. On one hand, this makes it really easy to keep it clean. But on the other, any imperfections cast a really obvious shadow on the mouse. Not too big of a deal.

Finally, battery life. The battery life is good. On a full charge, you can get about 3 weeks or so. I could probably get more if I turned the darn thing off, but whenever I do that I end up confused when I need to use it and forget its off.

Because there isn't much of a Windows integration, there is no alert when the mouse is low on battery or going to die. So you're moving the mouse and suddenly it dies, and you're left sitting there. Usually I just continue browsing the page using the Vivaldi spacial navigation feature on the keyboard.

Having the charging port on the bottom is stupid, but at the same time whatever. It charges fast, so I don't mind it being like that. I wish it wasn't like that, but if you really want to.

Overall, if you can choose not to use a Magic Mouse on Windows, just don't.
