Please, do not take more than 2 studio classes in the same semester! This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I have recently made, and I have made a lot of mistakes.

This may just be because I don't think I am a very creative person, but having to constantly do projects has been starting to get annoying. I spend half the time just coming up with the ideas for them. However, I have been able to at least manage them.

This is no longer the case. With the end of the semester quickly approaching, it's time for final projects. And man have I been stressed as ever, to the point where I'm forgetting who I am.

I've been working on 3 websites at once (this one included) as well as coming up with 2 projects, neither of which I think are that good. I finally finished one of those websites, and I think it is fine. But the other projects I think I have done really bad at.

Earlier I heard the sound of my phone go off, and I just stood there. I don't know why, but it kind of reminded me of who I was. It's been so long since I last heard that sound.

I'm sorry that I have been slow at responding to stuff. I know I have 2 guestbook messages to read. I know this article isn't good. I'm working on it all.
