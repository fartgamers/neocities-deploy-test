I have already talked about how much I [don't like getting gifts](gifts.html). But Christmas has always been extra stressful for me, mainly because I'm expected to make a list of things I want.

The thing is, I don't really have things I want, or the things I want are a little expensive. But the problem with that is more than one person is getting you gifts. So you have to come up with enough to make them go all around.

Not only this, but people are pressuring you to keep on making a list. They want one, they need one from you! And you only have so much time left. And you can't just say that you don't want anything. Man, I hate when people are being generous.

Plus, the problem with asking for a list is that people don't shop like how you do. For example, you might ask for something, and get some cheap knockoff, or something similar. I know you can send Amazon links to people, but that doesn't work all the time. 

And just because you put something on your list doesn't mean you're going to get it!

Overall, just send me money. Or a new job.
