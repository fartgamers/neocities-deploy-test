With how much returning "OG" Fortnite caused the game's popularity to spike, it seemed like a no-brainer for Epic Games to bring it back again. So here begins my [3 day long Fortnite phase](../10/fortniteblackhole.html) that happens every 6 months.

However, this time it's a little different. Previously, the map started on the Season 5 map. This time, the map is on the first map, the Season 0 map. This is cool, as most people didn't get to experience Season 0. But this isn't the only map. You can still play the current season's map as well. And I am really thankful for this, because Season 0 was kinda boring.

First off, there wasn't much variety in the items that were available during Season 0. This would be fun if the items and weapons that are available are all interesting. However, they aren't. There are only 2 or 3 of each weapon class, with each variation not being that different. You have the *assault rifle* and the *burst assault rifle*. The *pistol* and the *revolver*. The *pump shotgun* and the *tactical shotgun*. Not much is different.

The same thing applies to items. There are no mini shields, only 50 pots. I don't have a problem with this, but it's just a little boring. Plus, shields are harder to find. Once again, not a bad thing.

But the biggest thing is the map itself. I hate to admit it, but the first map was just really boring. Most of the points of interest are just towns with the same copy pasted buildings. There isn't a hotspot that people go to (once again not a bad thing). All of the interesting spots are unlabeled on the map, for example the factory or prison. There are 2 farms on the map that feel the exact same as each other.

Locations are so far apart it feels like a chore moving between them, especially as there isn't much between them, just grass, hills, and maybe an abandoned house. We are lucky that the current maps have so many features for traversing the terrain, and interesting spots along the way. I understand that this was the first map in the entire game, but it still sucked. Don't tell me that moisty mire is a good location, because it isn't. The desert was better in almost every way.

Finally, the last annoying thing is that people try way too hard in the original map. I don't know what it is, but people are fighting for their life. I have no problem with a game being hard, but can people stop pretending it's ranked (especially when there already is a ranked mode).

Overall, I'm happy they brought the first map back so people who never experienced it could experience it. But man have we come a long way since it.

Oh, and one more thing. **Can we bring limited time modes back**? Thank you.
