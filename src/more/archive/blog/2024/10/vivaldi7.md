Today the browser that I use, [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com){target=_blank}, got its 7.0 update. The Vivaldi team made a really big deal about this update, even [pretending to do a](https://vivaldi.com/blog/read-all-about-vivaldi-7-0/){target=_blank} Fortnite Chapter 2 by not releasing any patch notes (I said pretending because they did release patch notes, but they pretended not to). So... what are my thoughts?

## New Look

Vivaldi has looked pretty similar throughout it's entire lifespan. There have been some small differences and added options, but everything has been relatively the same. However, this update brings the largest, and most controversial visual refresh. Everything is much less compact, and tabs look more like on Firefox, where they appear as floating labels instead of tabs. This can be completely turned off, which is exactly what I, and everyone else did.

A lot of people, [especially young people](https://old.reddit.com/r/vivaldibrowser/comments/1gb6dk8/no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_noooooo/){target=_blank}, have been complaining about this because for some reason it became cool to hate on change 3 years ago. Oh no, a browser known for its customization options added customization options. I personally like the new design, however I would still prefer a more compact design, so that is what I'm going to be using.

Another thing that changed is the art style of the icons. Now the icons all use thin, two toned icons. I think they look good when enlarged, but when made small like they normally are, they just don't work. Luckily, you can revert to the old icon set.

I use a custom CSS theme, and I thought a lot of stuff would break with this theme change, but surprisingly I didn't have to do anything other than toggle 1 setting.

## Dashboard

The new tab page now contains a dashboard. You can add various widgets to your dashboard, such as embedded websites, feeds, bookmarks, emails, calendar, sticky notes, and more. Customization of this feed is really basic, but it works, and I'm happy enough with how it looks. I wish you could hide the title bars of embedded webpages, as well as see custom thumbnails for bookmark folders, but other than that it would be perfect.

## More?

Despite this being a major release, those are really the only changes. There are a few things related to the email side of Vivaldi, but I don't use those, and I don't think most people do either. I think people are being a little dramatic about change.
