People think that you cannot sideload on an iPhone unless you're in the EU, and you're technically right. However, there are still ways you can sideload elsewhere, and I would argue they're better. Okay, yes you need to pay a $100 one time fee to have more than 3 apps installed at a time, the apps do expire after a year, and they don't function as well as regular apps. But you can still download them, and that's all that matters. Okay, you also do need a computer. At least you don't need a bus pass anymore.

Anyways, for as niche as sideloading on iOS is, there are a surprising amount of apps available. The main thing is that most of the apps are just modded clients, but there are still quite a lot of them. However, you can also sideload older versions of apps. Because most apps rely on servers, these versions don't usually work. But it's still cool to peek into them. And you can usually access more screens if you sideload the modern version of the app, login, and then downgrade.

I discovered a secret, and this applies to both iOS and Android. You can just peek into the files for app files super easily. Both `.ipa` and `.apk` files are really just `.zip` files. Just rename them to `.zip` or use 7Zip and just peek into them.

This is fun because you can see random things you aren't supposed to see. But you can also edit the code and add your own modifications. Changing things in apps is kinda hard and annoying, but it can be really fun.
