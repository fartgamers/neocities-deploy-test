As a kid, I grew up watching some sports, and I enjoyed them, but not for the reason you would expect. I just liked sports because I enjoyed looking at all the numbers. By the time I went into third grade, I was basically done watching sports.

After that, I basically never cared about sports. The only game I would watch would be the super bowl, and that was just for the half time show. I became the person who would go out of their way to hate on sports. I just never understood why people liked sports. The only teams I liked were the teams I was told to like by my parents.

However, last year the Detroit Lions played an important game. I'm still not much into sports, but this game was important because if the Lions won, they would go to the Super Bowl. This never happens to the lions. But anyways, my parents made me tune into the game. So, I did, and I oddly enough enjoyed it. Sadly, the Lions didn't win. Usually they start out each game doing really good, and then start doing really bad about halfway through.

So, anyways, the Super Bowl came, and I was working during it, so I didn't really care whether I wanted to or not. Oh well. Didn't think the halftime show was that good either.

Anyways, I decided to download the Apple Sports app, because why not, you know. To be honest, the app is kind of useless, but one cool feature is that it puts live sports scores on your lock screen. This allows you to follow along with the game without even having to watch it. And this has been cool because I don't feel out of the loop. I still feel everything as it happens, without having to watch the TV.

However, I started also recently just putting on the games. I found out that I really like the background noise that sports provides. The sound of the audience cheering coming through the TV, I don't know, it's just such a nice sound. If the game is on FOX, you can just keep using incognito to continue opening new sessions when your free trial of FOX Sports expires. Or you can always just use IPTV, although IPTV buffers a lot.

And honestly, watching has been a lot of fun. Action isn't constantly happening, so you don't have to pay attention the entire time. I didn't know I would be having this much fun watching something I used to not care about. And the social aspect of sports is also really cool. I'm starting to feel like maybe I was missing out on something my entire life.
