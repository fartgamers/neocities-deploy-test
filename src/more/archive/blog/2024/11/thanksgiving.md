In terms of how holidays work, Thanksgiving is certainly a strange one.

The first thing is that most schools have a Thanksgiving break, but it's such a short one that it almost feels forced. Most schools usually only have Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday taken off. That's it. I'm sure people in school are happy to have these days off, but it's just such a specific timeframe that it makes you wonder what the point is.

Next, the meal itself. I've never met anybody who loves a Thanksgiving meal. They love specific parts of it, but never the whole thing.

And while we're at it, the whole Butterball boycott is dumb. Not because it's a bad thing, but because the report not only comes from PETA but is from 2006. That's funny to me for some reason. And, surprise, animal abuse happens in almost every meat related field. I will say, calling it "Nutterball" is a little funny.

Finally, I think the part most people remember about Thanksgiving is the awkward conversations. Because you have the entire extended family together, you get reminded of some colorful characters you wish you forgot about. Everyone always jokes about the one racist uncle bringing up politics. But then you remember this actually happens.

Also, do people actually enjoy the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade? The singing is the only good part.
