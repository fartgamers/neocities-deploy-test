Did most of the people who voted for Trump even know they were voting for **The President of the United States**? Obviously, yes, but their reactions felt like that of a sports team winning, rather than a president.

## i cannot speak

You will notice it's hard to have an actual conversation about the election with someone who voted for Trump online. If you see any posts about Kamala losing, the comments will be filled with the kind of copypasta spam you would expect from a Twitch chat. Emojis, all caps, phrases copy pasted until the character limit is reached, and not a single actual thought in sight. Try saying anything and you'll just be hit with ðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¤£ðŸ«µ.

From my experience silently observing, Trump voters that are able to speak in anything other than `right click` -> `Paste` (they don't know what a keyboard shortcut is) cite that their reason for voting is lower gas prices. I wonder if there was a reason gas was so low 4 years ago. People probably just stayed home (using 0 gas) because they felt like it. Voting for a candidate isn't going to make you any less poor.

For anybody who is trying to get epic owns on people, please **don't reply with more copypastas**. You're just as bad as they are. Remember, you're given a block button for a reason, so you should probably use it.

Anyways, you may be wondering why only one side of people are unable to speak coherently. It's probably because [only a little over a third of Trump voters got a college degree](https://apnews.com/article/election-harris-trump-women-latinos-black-voters-0f3fbda3362f3dcfe41aa6b858f22d12). It's harder to be tricked if you have common sense. You'll also notice that Trump voters like to use AI images more.

Another thing you will notice about Trump supporters is they love to watch people get angry. Now, it's important to note that both sides do this. However, no matter if you search "liberal meltdown", "democrat meltdown", "conservative meltdown", "left wing meltdown", or "right wing meltdown"; you will always see the same videos, all from the right wing.

Trump supporters love to pretend everyone who isn't for them is angry, when they're usually the angry ones. Here's a little game, remember this woman?

She isn't actually angry or having a meltdown, as many people like to pretend. She just happens to have really exaggerated facial expressions.

And the facial expressions aren't even really visible throughout the entire video. All that happened was someone took the one frame where they look bad, and used it out of context.

Anyways, I'm starting my own election. Anyone can join, the only condition is that you need to be able to complete the Wii Fit advanced balance test.
