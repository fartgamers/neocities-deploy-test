One of the weirdest parts of things happening is how the world keeps on spinning, during or after the event. Sometimes you forget that something even happened.

One of the biggest of these events for me was COVID-19. COVID and the lockdowns have changed the world in so many ways that aren't immediately obvious I can't even begin to dive into them here. I never got to physically say goodbye to my friends. I went an entire month without leaving the house. Life was completely changed for me and everyone else, and I feel like most people forgot COVID was even a thing that happened beyond "oh yeah I remember that".

Despite that, COVID was still one of the moments where the world "stopped". But that was only because the world had to stop. The previous time when I think the world (or at least the USA) stopped was 9/11, however I'm a newgen so I'm not sure. It feels like now whenever something happens, the world just keeps on spinning.

Around 3 years ago, a bomb threat was called into our school. It was after school, during a cross country practice. Suddenly we were just told to leave everything in place, and run to the forest. We were given no explanation as for why. But... we did. I found out because I had notifications turned on for our school's Twitter, however after about 5 minutes the football team came towards us and we were all informed about the situation by a staff member.

However, after that nothing really happened. We all came to school the next day and none of the teachers even acknowledged that it happened, except the progressive one (which was actually really nice). Granted, most of the students weren't in the school at that time, and the teachers didn't really care. However, it was still just weird that something like this happened to us and the most acknowledgement most people got was a morning announcement. By 2 days after the incident, nobody mentioned it anymore. It just kinda passed by.

A similar thing to this is when someone dies at a workplace. Granted, this doesn't happen as often, but to people who work at the location, and especially people who were clocked in during the incident, I can only imagine how it feels. I've read multiple stories on Reddit of people dying at their workspace, employees or customers (especially in retail and service), and how everyone just comes back to work the next day as if nothing happened.

I understand that the world cannot pause for every small event, but I sometimes wish there was a break. And, no, the weekend doesn't count.
