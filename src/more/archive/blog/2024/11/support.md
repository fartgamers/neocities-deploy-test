Working in IT and customer support has to be one of the worst jobs. Depending on where you work, you have to deal with customers who aren't good at using the product, who are also angry, frustrated, and just want their accounts to work. Not only that, but the amount of quick, repetitive tasks seems like it would start to get overwhelming.

Because of that, it makes sense that some aspects of customer support would start to get automated. I completely understand having pre-written replies for common issues. I don't see the reason to force employees to have to keep writing the same things over and over again.

However, the main problem, and this is especially true for big companies, is how automated support is becoming. Why do I have to Tweet at companies on Twitter to get customer support from a human?

About a year ago one of my YouTube videos got taken down for inappropriate content, despite the video just being Flow Free gameplay. Whenever I request a review from YouTube, I would instantly be denied. The only time I was able to somewhat get a human response was when I publicly mentioned @TeamYouTube on Twitter. When something happens to smaller YouTube channels, usually the only way for it to be resolved is through Twitter.

Another example happened to me 2 days ago. I mainly use Discord for talking to one person, rarely talking to other people or using servers. So imagine my surprise when out of nowhere my account was hit with a spam violation after trying to send a video of ChatGPT screaming. I emailed Discord support about it, and they sent me an automated reply to check the system notification from Discord for more information. I never got a system notification. And then yesterday, I got hit with **another** violation for the same thing.

I've Tweeted @DiscordSupport, however I haven't gotten a reply yet, as every email with support has been automated. Because this is Twitter in 2024 under Elon Musk, the only people I have gotten a reply from are spam bots. What fun.

Companies, please, at least keep customer support ran by the humans. Contacting customer support is usually one of the last things someone does, a last resort. So, please, make it work correctly, instead of sending me to an AI bot from 2014.
