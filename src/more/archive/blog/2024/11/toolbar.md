A few days ago I wrote an article about [switching up my workflow](maximize.html) with how I use Windows. One thing I wanted to experiment with was the rarely used toolbars in the taskbar. They're a good idea in concept, but they just don't work.

Pinning a folder to the toolbar on Windows is different than on MacOS. On a Mac, you get a shortcut to the folder. Clicking it opens the folder in one of three views:

- List
- Grid
- List but fancy

The main thing I like about this is quickly accessing files, for example screenshots. This is what I use ShareX for. However, I don't always want to open ShareX, so I decided to pin my screenshot folder to the taskbar.

It's useless, especially how I want to use it.

Maybe it has a few niche use cases (example a holding space), but it just doesn't work well. It's nice and compact (after changing a few basic settings) which I like, but useless otherwise. And that's entirely for one reason:

**You can't sort files**.

Every file is forced to be in alphabetical order. No matter what you do, they will always be like this.

So, yeah, thank goodness this feature was removed in Windows 11, because nobody should ever have to suffer from it again.
