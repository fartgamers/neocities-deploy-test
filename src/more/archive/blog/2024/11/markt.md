Today I went to the *Christkindl Markt* (Christmas Market).

First off, I forgot how much I love being in the city. You can walk everywhere, there are actual people, and there is variety in the buildings. When you aren't driving in them, being in a city is a blast.

Anyways, onto the market. It was honestly quite nice. It was also very expensive, but that's what I expected from a market. There was a little trolley that was free to ride going around the market and other locations of downtown. That was cute. The funny thing was that entire thing was Christmas themed, but the trolley was just playing regular pop music.

The first thing we got was Hot Kinderpunsch. I don't have any positive or negative thoughts about it. I wouldn't complain if I got it again, but at the same time I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. It came in a small, sock shaped container. It was cute, but due to the size wasn't that good of a deal for the price. The cool thing was that you could take the container home, and refills cost less (albeit still overpriced) if you have it.

After that, it was time for the shops. The shops were cute and had a lot of different things. It was also snowing while we were in the area, which really added to the festive vibe. Every stand used the same kind of building (a little wooden hut).

There was different kinds of things you could purchase, but also a lot of different kinds of food. I ended up getting a raclette, which was a baguette with cheese and other toppings both inside and at the top. I don't know what kind of cheese it was that was used, but it had a smell to it. I don't mind the smell of cheese, I kind of like it in a weird way. However, I don't like eating large globs of cheese.

After a little more shopping, we headed back. Overall, it was fun and cute, and made me feel like I was in a movie a little bit.
