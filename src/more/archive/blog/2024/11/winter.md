After multiple years of it snowing a little bit then not having barely any snow until after Christmas, the snow finally came early. Recently it has been snowing in Michigan. Nothing too serious, none of it stuck together, so you can't make a snowman.

However, I think most people forget just how annoying it is to be driving during the winter. Most people have dedicated winter tires. A lot of people either shovel their driveways and get snow plows.

The one nice thing about driving in the winter is that if you have broken AC, you're saved. It's much more likely to have broken AC than broken heat. However, at the same time I feel bad for people who do have broken heat. If you have broken AC (like me), you can still roll down the windows. It isn't perfect, but it works. But during the winter, this just makes it colder. Plus, if you're warm, you sweat. If you're cold, you start shivering, which makes it very difficult to focus on the road. I have heat, but it takes half my commute for it to warm up! Ahh!

The next thing is if you don't have a garage, you have to brush all the snow off your vehicle. This is fun if the snow is powdery, but getting it off the top of taller vehicles is annoying. And if it's icy snow, that's just annoying because you have to scrape it off.

Ice isn't as annoying as people say it is. Just don't drive fast on turns, take it slow and easy, and be prepared for a jump scare at any opportunity. Plus, most roads people actually use are plowed and have salt added to them, so that's not an issue. The only roads with ice are access roads and residential ones.

Despite the roads being the most annoying to drive on in the winter, they are also the biggest vibe. So everything bad about them is automatically forgiven. Man I love Winter.
