Today is November 3, which means that daylight savings time is over. That means that clocks are set an hour back. And I don't like this.

I'm someone who enjoys the dark. The day has beauty, but colors just pop more at night, and everything is just a little more interesting. Being in a city at night especially is an experience, as buildings usually have special displays for the nighttime. It's all beautiful.

The biggest thing is that I drive in the morning, as I don't do anything in the afternoon except work (which my commute for is really short, about 3 minutes). Because of that, the sun rising later has been really nice for me. However, today daylight savings time ended, so now the sun rises an hour earlier, and for what reason?

Okay, yeah, the sun rises earlier, but how does this affect anybody? To offset the change, the sun also sets much earlier. At `6:02 PM` its already completely dark outside. Who wanted this? Assuming someone works 9-5 and has an hour long commute, they hardly benefit from the sunrise changes, and are only inconvenienced by the sunset changes.

So, I have a proposal. Let's just keep daylight savings time. And if you think this is a bad idea, it's actually a good idea. The [Sunshine Protection Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/623){target=_blank} has been introduced in 2022, although it never got passed. This would make daylight savings time permanent. And honestly, that's all I want.
