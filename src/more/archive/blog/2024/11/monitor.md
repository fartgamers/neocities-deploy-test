One day I suddenly started craving a monitor. So I put one on my desk, and now I'm writing on it.

I use a laptop, not a desktop workstation, so this is somewhat dumb. I had to jump through a lot of hoops in order to actually start using the monitor.

First, I had to setup a docking station. This isn't because I need to quickly dock my laptop (although that is really nice) but rather so I can use both my monitor and drawing tablet at the same time. Also, because I am no longer using the laptop, I needed somewhere to put it. So... I put it on the floor. Definitely a good idea, especially because I have carpet. I just have the vents pointed in a spot where they just blow straight up, but this definitely needs some improvement.

First, things I like about the monitor.

I like how big it is. Although the screen resolution isn't any better, it makes me feel more important and productive. It also looks nicer. Because I have text anti-aliasing disabled, I can count the pixels, which is fun.

Now, things I don't.

First off, it's big. It starts to give me a headache if I'm using a light screen (which I prefer), so I had to turn down the display settings. Next, all audio comes from the bottom left of where I am, and plugging things into the laptop is a little more annoying. I also have to use a wireless mouse and keyboard. The mouse is fine (although it has no middle click), but the keyboard makes my hands cramp. And finally, the status light on the monitor is so bright when it's off. Why would you need a light to tell me that it's turned off? I understand when in standby, but when you're off? Come on! And it's brighter than the light when it's on. Finally, my desk is too small, so I have no space to put anything (I already didn't have space, but now I have less of it).

In conclusion, I really love using this monitor. I probably won't get rid of it in 2 weeks.
