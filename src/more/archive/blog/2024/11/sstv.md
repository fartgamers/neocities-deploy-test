This title reads like something out of BuzzFeed, but I don't care.

Over the years, a ton of different methods to try and bypass filters have come and gone. But I think the funniest one has cropped up recently.

First off, most of the ways that people sneak images through the filter is usually for porn. I don't like that, however I have to give credit where credit is due, these people are creative. The old method would be hiding the image in a video, maybe having it appear in a mirror, making it highly transparent, or have it flash for a frame.

However, this new method is much more involved for both parties. And although I don't like what it's doing, I have to admit that it's quite creative. People are now sharing images through Slow Scan Television signals, specifically Robot 36.

Robot 36 makes the most sense because it's easily accessible due to an Android app being available. I'm realizing how robotic my writing sounds, do you guys actually put up with this? The only (working) Android device I have is my car, and the mic in my car will definitely compress the signals. So here's what one of the images looks like decoded on a computer:

Although this unusual method of image sharing is highly effective at not getting caught, it is also impractical due to the image quality and effort. It works only as a party trick, but I'm fine with that. I never thought the kids would be getting into SSTV in the first place, even if it's for a meme.
