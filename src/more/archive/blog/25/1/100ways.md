New Years Resolutions don't work, however I still like the concept of them. I feel like I'm in the stage of my life where I'm starting to try and figure out who I am, but I'm still far from actually figuring that out. But I'm realizing I need to change in more ways than just simply "working out".

My solution was to make a list of goals with the intention of completing as many of them as I can before the year ends. Currently I have 100 goals, I was going to do 250 because that's the Todoist task limit, but I deeply struggled coming up with only 100. The point isn't to try and complete all of these before the end of the year, but to complete as many as I can.

Realistically, I'm not expecting myself to complete many of them, but I still want to try. There are a lot of different areas that I could improve myself on.

I would **love** to share the ideas, but I don't think that putting it publicly on the internet for anyone to view would be a good idea. "Hey, here's a list of everything that bothers me, go wild." The main things are:

- I would like to become more social
- I want to discover my hobbies and better express them
