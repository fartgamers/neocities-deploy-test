Most people think I like wearing sweatshirts that have hoods on them. And while that is correct, I don't wear them for the hoods themselves, but instead the drawstrings.

I don't know why, but I just really love drawstrings. I love the look of them, and I love using them. The main reason for liking them is being able to idly fidget with them. There are so many fun things you can do with two thick pieces of string. For one, you can twirl them around your fingers. You can twirl one, or you can twirl both. You can also cross them against each other. Or you can just pull down on them, which is the intended function.

But maybe the second reason I enjoy them is because I like seeing them dangle. It adds a certain amount of variety to clothing. I especially love when the drawstrings aren't just the same color as the sweatshirt.

If a sweatshirt doesn't have drawstrings, I don't wear the sweatshirt. When I'm not wearing a sweatshirt, I by habit frequently try to reach for drawstrings, only to realize that they aren't there. I'm a little sad, because global warming means that there will be less and less time to wear sweatshirts. Less sweatshirts mean less drawstring. And playing with the drawstrings on sweatpants makes it look like you're fondling your ball sack.
