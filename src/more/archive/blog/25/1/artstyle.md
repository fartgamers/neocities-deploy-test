I'm not one to hate on what people draw, but at the same time I cannot help but feel like art styles are starting to get a little boring. There are three main art styles that I see getting abused:

- Newgrounds style
- Vector style (I'm aware that this is a broad term, but there is a specific style)
- "Old web"/emo

The Newgrounds style is especially annoying, because not only does all the art look the same, but everyone with it has the same personality. They all have the same evil OCs who always carry an assault rifle and shoot people just because. Granted, I don't have much to speak on this part because my character does the same thing somewhat, but at least I made him less evil over the years.

Another reason for the same personality reason is they all have the exact same music taste. TikTok music taste is an understatement, because most people who have the "TikTok taste" at least try to find other music. However, the Spotify algorithm turns everyone into one person. This is a bigger issue that I'm not going to go into here as there is a lot to say about Spotify. Instead, people with the Newgrounds style just listen to whatever songs are popular within that part of the app. But they never try expanding their tastes. It's not even that hard to look at an artists top tracks.

Now I'm not saying that everyone with the Newgrounds style is like this. In fact most aren't. But the people who picked it up recently all need to learn how to be unique. Or don't, I honestly don't care. It just pains me because the Newgrounds style is really unique, and it hurts to see the same things over and over again.

As for the old web style, this one at least takes practice, and is dying. When done correctly, artworks can actually look really nice. However, not much really works in this art style, so I can see why people are shifting away from it.

As for the vector style, I actually really like it. The main issues come from people who I don't feel are quite able to pull it off. The main reason for this one becoming popular is the rise of a certain artist.

Overall, I don't care. You can draw whatever makes you happy, it doesn't affect me. I'm not saying that I have a super unique style either. I would just say don't copy a style completely, but instead incorporate the things you like about it and add it to your existing style.

Thank you for watching my stupid video.
