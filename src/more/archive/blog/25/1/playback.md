Hey, happy 2025!

It's the end of the year, so that means it's time to look at basically the Spotify Wrapped again, but long after anybody cares anymore.

*Unrelated but quick side thing, one of the things I love about having a personal blog is that I can call it last.fm, not last fm. Not having to worry about the link automatically becoming a rich embed is so nice.*

last.fm has always had end of the year reports, but last year they introduced Playback, which is Spotify Wrapped but last.fm. On top of that, they also refreshed the look of the reports, and added more information to them, which is nice to know that last.fm developers still exist.

Although the design of playback isn't anything too interesting, its at least nice to look at, and there's a clever Joy Division reference thrown in there.

One cool thing about playback is the usage of internal information. For example, graphs would be shown of how the amount you listened to an artist compared to the average. I really wish that the last.fm team would share more stats. Although it would encourage even more scrobble farming than what already happens, it would be cool to know the most scrobbled songs of all time on the platform, or what people are listening to a track right now.

Anyways, I'm just happy that last.fm is carrying on as strong as ever. It feels like one of the last remnants of early Web 2.0.
